# Constrained Planning Problems from the Domains of IPC2023

This benchmark consists of PDDL planning problem instances with constraints for the domains used in the [International Planning Competition (IPC) 2023](https://ipc2023.github.io).

## Repository Structure

There is one folder for each IPC domain, containing its PDDL domain file and the following two subfolders:
    - ground: containing problem instances with ground constraints
    - nonground: containing problem instances where constraints include quantifiers
